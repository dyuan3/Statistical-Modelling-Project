# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
This project is about to use API request to get the data of the bikes number in a specific city. Also it needs to get the data about the location of the bike station. Then the data of the bikes number would be compared with the bike station. We can observe that what the relationship is between these two.

## Process
Step 1. Use the http provided to api request the number of bikes in paris.
Step 2. Use Foursquare and Yelp to api request the longitude and latitude of the bike stations 
Step 3. Use the data about the bike numbers and bike stations to merge into a new dataframe and visualize it
Step 4. Build a regression line of this data frame
### (your step 2)

## Results
Acording to the regression line, I can see that the variance of the number of city bikes and location of the bike stations is very small. It means that the there are more city bikes, there will be more bike stations.

## Challenges 
It will be a question that it is good to use a regression line model to research on this project. But my statistic know is quite limited. It is the current model that I can use to research on this case.

## Future Goals
I will use multiple models to analyze this case.
